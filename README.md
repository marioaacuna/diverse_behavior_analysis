# diverse_behavior_analysis
This repo contains MATLAB scripts for the analysis of some mouse behaviors.
So far, it is a compilation of scripts that were laying around for different porpuses and of different experimenters at the Nevian lab.
All these scripts are authored by Mario A. Acu√±a, and if anything needed, drop him an email to mario.acuna@unibe.ch
